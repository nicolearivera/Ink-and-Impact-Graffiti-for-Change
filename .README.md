#I chose graffiti as my topic because it is something close to me given where I grew up. It is also everywhere in the world and says more about a place then photos in my opinion. I had also recently presented on it at a national conference and thought that revamping the powerpoint into a webpage would be cool to do.#
#I do have permission from the artists/ muralists mentioned to use their materials.#
