    <h1>Welcome to Ink & Impact: The Cultural Significance of Graffiti</h1>
<body>
    <h2>Historical Roots</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>From ancient cave paintings to modern urban murals</li>
        <li>Key sites: NYC’s 5 Pointz, LA’s Arts District</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Community Voice</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reflects identity and social struggles, especially in underrepresented communities</li>
        <li>Acts as a cultural map of urban life</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Graffiti as an educational tool</h2>
    <p>Graffiti can be a dynamic teaching tool. It naturally connects to art, history, politics, and sociology, making it ideal for interdisciplinary learning. 
        Students can analyze it for meaning, context, and style—much like literature or media. It prompts conversations about identity, public space, freedom of expression, and censorship. 
        It encourages visual literacy and invites students to think critically about whose voices get heard. Most importantly, it can validate student experiences, especially those from urban or marginalized communities. 
        It challenges them to think about legality, authorship, and public voice – all critical to civic engagement.
    When students engage with graffiti, they develop key 21st-century skills. It encourages critical thinking—debating legality vs. artistic value. 
    It sparks creative expression, allowing students to experiment with symbolism, color, and storytelling. 
    And it fosters global citizenship, helping students understand diverse narratives and perspectives. 
    Graffiti helps students think about identity: who they are, what they stand for, and how they want to be seen in the world.</p>
