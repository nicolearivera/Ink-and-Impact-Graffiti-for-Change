    <h3>Timeline of Graffiti's Evolution</h3>
    <p>Graffiti has a rich and varied history, tracing back thousands of years. Below is a chronological timeline highlighting key developments in graffiti from ancient times to the modern era.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ancient Origins</li>
        <li>Prehistoric Era: The earliest forms of graffiti can be seen in cave paintings, with examples dating back approximately 30,000 years in locations like Chauvet Cave in France, where abstract shapes and animals were painted as expressions of human experience.</li>
        <li>Ancient Rome (78 BC): Graffiti was prevalent in Roman cities such as Pompeii, often depicting themes related to sex, politics, and daily life. These writings provide significant insights into the social dynamics of the time.</li>
        <li>Modern Graffiti Emergence</li>
        <li>1960s: Modern graffiti began in Philadelphia, with artists like Darryl McCray (known as "Cornbread") pioneering the practice by tagging their names across the city. This movement quickly spread to New York City by the late 1960s.</li>
        <li>1970s: The graffiti scene exploded in New York, with artists using subway trains as canvases. Notable figures included Taki 183 and Phase 2, who introduced more elaborate styles and techniques. The term "graffiti" gained popularity during this period, originally coined by The New York Times</li>
        <li>Cultural Integration and Backlash</li>
        <li>1980s: Graffiti became closely associated with hip-hop culture and punk movements. The release of the documentary "Style Wars" in 1982 highlighted the artistic aspects of graffiti but also contributed to its criminalization. This decade saw a crackdown on graffiti as cities attempted to control urban decay</li>
        <li>1990s: The rise of the internet allowed graffiti artists to share their work globally. However, increased law enforcement efforts labeled graffiti as vandalism, leading to arrests and fines for many artists</li>
        <li>Contemporary Developments</li>
        <li>2000s: Artists like Banksy emerged, reshaping public perceptions of graffiti as a legitimate art form. His works often contained political messages and were displayed in galleries, bridging the gap between street art and fine art</li>
        <li>2006 Onwards: The internet continued to influence graffiti culture, allowing for new styles such as calligraffiti—an integration of traditional calligraphy with street art aesthetics. Festivals celebrating graffiti began to emerge worldwide, reflecting its acceptance as a form of artistic expression</li>
        <li>Present Day</li>
        <li>Today, graffiti is celebrated in various forms across the globe. Events like Upfest in Bristol and the Cans Festival in London highlight its cultural significance. Despite ongoing debates about its legality and artistic value, graffiti remains a vibrant part of urban culture</li>
